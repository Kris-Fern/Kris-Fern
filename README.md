- 👋 Hi! I’m Kris Fern (call me Kris).
- 🏳️‍🌈 I'm queer and also gender apathetic, I don't mind what pronouns you use for me.
- 👀 I’m into video games (Splatoon 2 and Minecraft specifically), translations, and the preservation of the environment.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying at uni.
- ✨ I’m looking to collaborate on video game translations. I would love to translate some childhood games into my mother tongue (Catalan).
- 🪄 My current focus is Harry Potter and the Philosophers stone for the GBC.
- 📫 You can reach me on my twitter @InklingKris
